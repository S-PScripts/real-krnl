Installing on Android:
- Uninstall (Krnl) Roblox
- Download the latest version of Krnl. If you are Vietnamese, make sure to get VNG.
WARNING: IF YOU GET VNG, YOUR ROBLOX ACCOUNT WILL BE REGION-LOCKED TO VIETNAM AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE GLOBAL ROBLOX ANYMORE ON THAT ACCOUNT. THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE.
- Click on the download and install
- That's all!

If you open Roblox and it gives an update pop-up without any "Not Now" option, join the Krnl Discord server and wait until the devs ping about an update for Krnl.
Once they ping, follow the steps above.
