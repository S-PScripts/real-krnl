# real-krnl - Krnl Docs
Krnl is a free Roblox exploit (or script executor) that allows users to run custom Lua scripts within Roblox games. It’s often used for modifying gameplay, automating actions, or accessing game features not normally available. Krnl is known for being stable, powerful, and frequently updated, but using it violates Roblox’s Terms of Service and can lead to account bans (if detected by Roblox, but they won't!).

>This site is unofficial - the real site is https://krnl.cat. However, I have permission to run it.
>The code is made by ChatGPT, but it's cleaner than Discord pins, and that's what counts.
