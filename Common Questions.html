  <h1>Krnl Common Questions</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Is Krnl safe? Is Krnl detected?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
<p>
    Yes, Krnl is safe. It is usually undetected, but make sure to check the channel in the <code>#STATUS</code> category on the Krnl server for your platform (iOS, Android, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    Status colors:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Undetected — you can use it without risk of being banned by Roblox, and it is working.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Detected — using it may result in a ban, but it is still functional.</li>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> Not working.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


    </div>

    <h2>When will Krnl Windows release?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
    There is no official release date yet, but it may launch in October 2025. The delay is due to extensive testing, as the goal is to make it the first fully undetected Windows executor.
    </div>

    
    <h2>What is VNG?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
    In Vietnam, Roblox is officially available through a localized version known as Roblox VN. 
    This version is developed by Roblox Corporation and published by VNG Corporation, a leading Vietnamese technology company. 
    The partnership was formalized in May 2024 to ensure compliance with Vietnamese laws and regulations.
    Since many Vietnamese people use Roblox exploits, Krnl has a VNG version for them!
    </div>

    <h2>What's with the ads in Krnl iOS Direct Install? Why does it lead to Delta sometimes?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
    Direct Install is provided by a third-party distributor (Skibidi Tech). They add ads to probably make money. 
    They prefer Delta more, which is why updates come faster for that executor, and why the Krnl iOS DI download page sometimes leads to Delta.
    </div>

    <h2>Is Delta or Krnl better?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
    I prefer Krnl more, but it's up to you to decide.
    </div>

    <h2>What are some good Windows executors?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      None. They are all detected; you'll get banned by Roblox for using them. Even if you do not care, I will not be mentioning any here.
    </div>
    
    <h2>I can’t search scripts in the script hub.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      That’s not Krnl’s fault — it’s <strong>ScriptBlox</strong>. Use a VPN such as <em>ProtonVPN</em> or <em>Cloudflare WARP</em> to bypass the rate limit.  
      If it happens again, switch VPN servers or try another VPN.
    </div>

    <h2>Why can’t I buy things in Roblox with Krnl?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Krnl Roblox has an untoggleable <strong>anti-buy</strong> for safety. If you want to spend Robux, install the normal Roblox app instead.
    </div>

    <h2>Krnl crashes when I open it.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Make sure you open Roblox in <strong>portrait mode</strong> (keep auto-rotate <u>OFF</u>).  
      If it still crashes, try opening in landscape too.  
      You may also need to adjust your <strong>DPI</strong> and restart your phone to fix it.
    </div>

    <h2>I keep getting kicked from Roblox games.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      This might be caused by something in your <strong>auto-execute</strong>.  
      Use <em>Zarchiver</em> or <em>CX File Explorer</em>, go to the Krnl folder, and delete everything inside the <code>autoexec</code> folder.
      You might need to reinstall Krnl afterwards.
    </div>

    <h2>I got banned from a Roblox game due to exploits!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Krnl bypasses Roblox's anti-cheat. You can't get banned by Roblox themselves. However, some games have their own anti-cheat that can detect Krnl, especially if you execute a (detected) script.
    </div>

    
    <h2>Where can I find scripts?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Go to <a href="https://scriptblox.com">ScriptBlox</a> or <a href="https://rscripts.net">RScripts</a>.
    </div>

    <h2>I tried executing a script and it didn't work.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
     Try another script. It may be that the script you tried is patched/broken. It might also be that Krnl doesn't support something in it. You can check for errors by opening the Developer Console.
    </div>

    <h2>I'm getting "New App Available" when I log into my account!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      You have logged into Krnl VNG before, so your account has been region-locked to Vietnam. This cannot be changed due to Vietnamese laws. From now on, you'll need to use (Krnl) VNG Roblox on mobile (though you can still use the global version of Roblox on PC).
    </div>

    <h2>I'm getting an update pop-up!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      If you open Roblox and it gives an update pop-up without any "Not Now" option, join the Krnl Discord server and wait until the devs ping about an update for Krnl. Once they ping, uninstall and reinstall Krnl.
    </div>

    <h2>Can I bypass the key system?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      NO! This is NOT allowed.
    </div>

    <h2>What is Krnl's sUNC?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      <a href="https://sunc.rubis.app/?scrap=gNoCwGOBq1R9ZIt4&key=tgUr5UqU637uvDAsbISvVzaixt2Gkr4F" target="_blank">80% sUNC</a> as of 6th August 2025. 
      NOTE: A failed function does not always mean it is broken or missing. It may still work, but failed one of sUNC's checks.
