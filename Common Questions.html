  <h1>Delta Common Questions</h1>

  
  <div class="content">

            <h2>What is Delta?</h2>

        <div class="answer">
    Delta is a free Roblox exploit (or script executor) that allows users to run custom Lua scripts within Roblox games. 
    It’s often used for modifying gameplay, automating actions, or accessing game features not normally available. 
    Delta is known for being stable, powerful, and frequently updated, but using it violates Roblox’s Terms of Service and can lead to account bans (if detected by Roblox, but they won't!).
        </div>

        <h2>What's the official website for Delta?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      <a href="https://deltaexploits.gg/">deltaexploits.gg</a> 
    </div>
    
    <h2>Is Delta safe? Is Delta detected?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        Yes, Delta is safe. It is usually undetected, but make sure to check #announcements in the Delta server for your platform (iOS, Android).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>I got banned by Roblox for using Delta.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Have you used another executor? If you have not, you might have used an old version of Delta, used it when it was marked as detected in the Delta server, or an unofficial copy.
      NOTE: If you got banned for 6 months, you must have used another detected executor before. You only get 1 day the first time you're banned by the anti-cheat.
    </div>

    <h2>Does Delta support 32-bit and 64-bit devices?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      It does!
    </div>
    
    <h2>I got an emulator to use Delta, but it's crashing!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      BlueStacks: Make sure you're using an Android 13 instance (rather than Pie). If you still get crashes, try using another emulator.
    </div>

    <h2>I am getting "The app cannot be installed because its integrity could not be verified", what do I do?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Please choose another ESign/KSign - the one you tried is revoked. Try using Direct Install or sideload with a computer.
    </div>

    <h2>I'm getting "New App Available" when I log into my account!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      You have logged into Roblox VNG before, so your account has been region-locked to Vietnam. This cannot be changed due to Vietnamese laws. From now on, you'll need to use VNG Roblox on mobile (though you can still use the global version of Roblox on PC).
      ROBLOX SUPPORT WILL NOT HELP!
    </div>

    <h2>What is VNG?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      In Vietnam, Roblox is officially available through a localised version known as Roblox VN. 
      This version is developed by Roblox Corporation and published by VNG Corporation, a leading Vietnamese technology company. 
      The partnership was formalised in May 2024 to ensure compliance with Vietnamese laws and regulations.
    </div>

    <h2>What's with the ads in Delta iOS Direct Install? Why does it lead to Delta sometimes?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Direct Install is provided by a third-party distributor (Skibidi Tech). They add ads to make money. 
      They prefer Delta more, which is why updates come faster for that executor, and why the Delta iOS DI download page sometimes leads to Delta.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Why does Delta want access to my files?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      This is used by some scripts to save settings. It's also where auto-execute scripts are saved.
    </div>

    <h2>I'm not waiting 1 hour with this Linkvertise just to use Delta!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Please use LootLabs!
    </div>

    <h2>How do I see the Workspace folder?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Download <em>ZArchiver</em> or <em>CX File Explorer</em> and find the Delta folder!
    </div>

    <h2>How/Where can I buy a key?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      You can ask for availability by submitting a ticket. However, you cannot buy permanent ones (they are only monthly).
      If you don't want to make a ticket/there are none being sold, buy Linkvertise Premium or Unlock-R for Lootlabs.
    </div>

    <h2>What are some good Windows executors?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      None. They are all detected; you'll get banned by Roblox for using them. Even if you do not care, I will not be mentioning any here.
    </div>  
    
    <h2>I can’t search scripts in the script hub.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      That’s not Delta’s fault — it’s <strong>ScriptBlox</strong>. Use a VPN such as <em>ProtonVPN</em> or <em>Cloudflare WARP</em> to bypass the rate limit.  
      If it happens again, switch VPN servers or try another VPN.
    </div>

    <h2>Why can’t I buy things in Roblox with Delta?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Delta Roblox has <strong>Robux protection</strong> for safety. If you want to spend Robux, turn it off.
    </div>

    <h2>Delta crashes when I open it.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Make sure you open Roblox in <strong>portrait mode</strong> (keep auto-rotate <u>OFF</u>).  
      If it still crashes, try opening in landscape too.  
      You may also need to adjust your <strong>DPI</strong> and restart your phone to fix it (start off with 360).
    </div>

    <h2>I keep getting kicked from Roblox games.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      This might be caused by something in your <strong>auto-execute</strong>.  
      Use <em>Zarchiver</em> or <em>CX File Explorer</em>, go to the Delta folder, and delete everything inside the <code>autoexec</code> folder.
      You might need to reinstall Delta afterwards.
    </div>

    <h2>I got banned from a Roblox game due to exploits!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Delta bypasses Roblox's anti-cheat. You can't get banned by Roblox itself. However, some games have their own anti-cheat that can detect Delta, especially if you execute a (detected) script.
    </div>

    <h2>Where can I find scripts?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Go to <a href="https://scriptblox.com">ScriptBlox</a>, <a href="https://rscripts.net">RScripts</a> or <a href="https://haxhell.com">HaxHell</a>.
    </div>

    <h2>I tried executing a script, and it didn't work.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Try another script. It may be that the script you tried is patched/broken. It might also be that Delta doesn't support something in it. You can check for errors by opening the Developer Console.
      Try using a VPN that connects to a different country as well.
    </div>

    <h2>I'm getting an update pop-up!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      If you open Roblox and it gives an update pop-up without any "Not Now" option, join the Delta Discord server and wait until the devs ping about an update for Delta. Once they ping, uninstall and reinstall Delta.
    </div>

    <h2>Can I bypass the key system?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      NO! This is NOT allowed.
    </div>

    <h2>I tried to download Delta, but it says "App not installed as package conflicts with an existing package"/"App not installed as package appears to be invalid".</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Usually, this is because you didn't uninstall Roblox; if not, please create a ticket. There are other reasons why this happens. </br>
      <br> Note: IT MAY BE IN YOUR SECURE FOLDER IF YOU HAVE ONE! </br>
      <br> Note: ATTEMPT TO REINSTALL THE VERSION OF Delta YOU USED BEFORE AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T KEEP ANY DATA BEFORE UNINSTALLING. </br>
      <br> This bug is NOT exclusive to Delta and many other people have this problem. There is unfortunately no easy fix to it. </br>

    </div>

    <h2>I tried to download Delta, but it says "There was a problem parsing the package".</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Make sure your Android version is at a minimum, Android 13.
    </div>

    <h2>I got the key, but Verify Key does nothing!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Try using a VPN. If that doesn't work, reinstall.
    </div>
    
    <h2>The key didn't work!</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      Generate another key.
    </div>

    <h2>What is Delta's sUNC?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
      <a href="https://sunc.rubis.app/?scrap=5YdnSVuyQ788Nh06&key=BA8VsjyzkhVG5r8AHeSJAQFQwnvI9day" target="_blank">91% sUNC</a> as of 16th September 2025. 
      NOTE: A failed function does not always mean it is broken or missing. It may still work, but failed one of sUNC's checks.
